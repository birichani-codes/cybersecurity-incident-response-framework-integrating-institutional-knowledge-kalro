# Prototype Framework to Improve Cybersecurity Incident Response Using Institutional Knowledge

## A Case Study of Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO)

---

## Description

This project presents a **prototype framework** to enhance cybersecurity incident response by capturing, structuring, and integrating **institutional knowledge** — the accumulated expertise, experience, and undocumented know-how held by individuals within an organization.

Many organizations rely on undocumented expert experience that exists only in the minds of long-serving staff. When those individuals leave or are unavailable, critical response capability is lost. This prototype demonstrates how tacit, individual knowledge can be transformed into **searchable, versioned, reusable intelligence** to support faster and more effective incident response.

The design follows **NIST Cybersecurity Framework principles**, **SECI Knowledge Management**, and **MIST design concepts** to ensure modularity, security, and integration with existing tools.

---

## Objectives

- Explore methods to capture undocumented institutional knowledge
- Prototype integration into cybersecurity workflows
- Demonstrate improvements in response speed and decision-making
- Reduce dependency on individual expertise (proof-of-concept)
- Create a **searchable, versioned repository** for organizational knowledge
- Establish a knowledge lifecycle with decay detection, versioning, and retirement

---

## Key Features

- **Role-based authentication with optional 2FA**
- **Interactive React dashboard for incident monitoring**
- **Institutional knowledge capture and annotation**
- **Confidence scoring on retrieved knowledge entries**
- **Version control and knowledge retirement lifecycle**
- **Full-text search and retrieval of past incidents**
- **Automatic knowledge suggestions when a new incident is logged**
- **Contributor attribution on all knowledge entries**
- **Escalation workflow for unknown or unmatched incidents**
- **Comprehensive audit trail of all system actions**
- **Integration with logs and threat intelligence feeds**

## Framework Alignment

This prototype aligns with established frameworks and design principles to ensure **security, scalability, and effective knowledge management**.

### NIST Cybersecurity Functions
Provides structured incident management across the full lifecycle.

- **Identify** — Know assets, risks, and existing institutional knowledge
- **Protect** — Secure access through RBAC, encryption, and 2FA
- **Detect** — Monitor logs, alerts, and incoming incident signals
- **Respond** — Execute mitigation strategies informed by institutional knowledge
- **Recover** — Capture lessons learned, update knowledge base, restore operations

### SECI Knowledge Management
Captures and shares institutional knowledge across the organization.

- **Socialization** — Team discussions and collaboration on incidents
- **Externalization** — Annotate and record incident insights into the knowledge base
- **Combination** — Integrate knowledge across incidents and departments
- **Internalization** — Apply lessons learned to future responses

### MIST Design Principles
Ensures modularity, security, and modern system design.

- **Microservices** — Separate components: Auth, Incident, Knowledge, NLP/Tagging
- **Integration** — Connect with external systems (Logs, IDS, Threat Feeds)
- **Security** — Role-based access control, encryption, 2FA, audit logging
- **Technology** — React SPA + REST API + PostgreSQL; supports future NLP automation

### TRIKER Knowledge Lifecycle
Guides the complete institutional knowledge lifecycle.

- **Trigger** — Initiate workflows when incidents occur or actions are performed
- **Record** — Document insights, annotations, and lessons learned
- **Integrate** — Merge new knowledge with the existing repository
- **Knowledge** — Structure information for easy retrieval and analysis
- **Evaluate** — Assess quality, relevance, accuracy, and confidence of captured knowledge
- **Reuse** — Apply past knowledge to improve future incident responses

## Knowledge Lifecycle Management

A key component of this framework is explicit management of the knowledge entry lifecycle to prevent outdated information from misleading analysts.

### Knowledge Entry States

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Active** | Current, trusted, and recommended for use |
| **Superseded** | Replaced by a newer version — visible but flagged |
| **Retired** | Archived; no longer applicable or accurate |

### Confidence Scoring

Every knowledge entry carries a **confidence score** (0.0 – 1.0) calculated from:

- Recency of last use
- Number of times successfully applied
- Analyst feedback and ratings
- Time elapsed since creation (decay factor)

Scores decay over time if an entry is not reused, prompting administrators to review and update it.

### Versioning

When an existing entry is updated, the old version is preserved with a `superseded_by` reference. Analysts can always view the full version history of any knowledge entry.

### Contributor Attribution

Every entry records who created it and who last modified it. This supports accountability, trust assessment, and knowledge quality reviews.

---

## Escalation Workflow

When a new incident arrives and **no matching knowledge is found**, the system follows a structured escalation path rather than leaving analysts without guidance:

```
New Incident Logged
       ↓
Auto-search Knowledge Base
       ↓
Match Found? ──YES──→ Display suggestions with confidence scores
       ↓ NO
Escalation Flag Set (status: "escalated")
       ↓
Notify assigned senior analyst / admin
       ↓
Manual investigation and response
       ↓
On resolution → Capture new knowledge entry
       ↓
Knowledge base updated for future incidents
```

Incident statuses: `open → investigating → escalated → resolved → closed`

---

## Audit Trail

Every action in the system is recorded in a tamper-evident audit log including:

- User identity and role
- Action performed (login, view, annotate, create, update, retire, search)
- Target entity (incident ID, knowledge entry ID)
- Timestamp
- IP address and session metadata

Audit logs are read-only and accessible only to Super Admins.

## Prototype Workflow (Pseudo-Algorithm)

```text
BEGIN

// MIST: Microservices Initialization
1. Initialize Services:
   - Auth Service
   - Incident Service
   - Knowledge Service
   - Integration Service
   - NLP/Tagging Service

// NIST: IDENTIFY
2. Load System Context:
   - assets, users, existing institutional knowledge

3. Authenticate User (React login form → Express API)
   INPUT: credentials + optional 2FA (TOTP)
   IF valid THEN
       issue JWT, store in React context
       grant role-based (RBAC) access
   ELSE
       deny access, log attempt
   ENDIF

// MIST: Integration
4. Collect Incident Data from logs, IDS, threat feeds

// NIST: DETECT
5. Detect or Log Incident (React form → POST /api/incidents)
   IDENTIFY anomalies, type, severity, affected entities

6. Extract Entities: IP address, user account, file hash

// NIST: RESPOND
7. Auto-Query Institutional Knowledge Base (GET /api/search)
   IF match found THEN
       DISPLAY entries with confidence scores in React UI
   ELSE
       SET status = "escalated"
       NOTIFY senior analyst / admin
   ENDIF

8. Analyst reviews knowledge, adds annotations, executes response

// NIST: RECOVER
9. On incident resolution -> prompt to capture new knowledge
   RECORD observations, lessons learned, effective mitigations

// MIST: Technology
10. Process new knowledge entry (POST /api/knowledge):
    - NLP tagging and categorization
    - Confidence score initialization
    - Version check (supersede existing entry if applicable)
    - Full-text search index update
    - Store in PostgreSQL

// MIST Security + NIST Protect
11. Enforce Security throughout:
    - Encrypt data at rest and in transit (HTTPS)
    - Validate JWT on every API request (Express middleware)
    - Enforce RBAC per route
    - Write all actions to audit log

// Knowledge Lifecycle
12. Scheduled job: decay confidence scores for unused entries
    FLAG entries below threshold for admin review
    RETIRE or UPDATE flagged entries

// Continuous Improvement
13. Feedback loop:
    - Analysts rate knowledge usefulness in React UI
    - Ratings update confidence scores via API
    - Reports surface most/least useful knowledge entries

END
